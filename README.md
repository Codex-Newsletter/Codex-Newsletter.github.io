#### Harshita Raj (batch 2018-2022)

Harshita Raj (batch 2018-22) is a magnificent web-developer who is  an active Open Source contributor. Her project Scrum Management has been an ongoing project under various open source programs such as AOS, SWOC, SLOP, etc. It is built on ***EJS***. For front-end they’ve used ***HTML, CSS and Javascript***, and ***MongoDB*** for back-end. It is completed upto 60% and open for valuable contributions. It is a project built for helping various organizations to summarise all projects under one roof. She along with her team have developed a single page website login system and another page for students who are working on different projects. In another page they have an admin option where one person can be assigned as a mentor for a student and guide him/her throughout the project by viewing the details of the project and the project under different columns like a Kanban board. Also as soon as they accept their profile will be shown under different cards that the student's project has been assigned with a mentor. So there are different columns with cards such as sticky notes which can be shifted through one column and another. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Harshita248/Scrum-Management)
