#### Harshita Raj (batch 2018-2022)

Harshita Raj (batch 2018-22) is a magnificent web-developer who is  an active Open Source contributor. Her project Scrum Management has been an ongoing project under various open source programs such as AOS, SWOC, SLOP, etc. It is built on EJS. For front-end they’ve used HTML, CSS and Javascript, and MongoDB for back-end. It is completed upto 60% and open for valuable contributions. It is a project built for helping various organizations to summarise all projects under one roof. She along with her team have developed a single page website login system and another page for students who are working on different projects. In another page they have an admin option where one person can be assigned as a mentor for a student and guide him/her throughout the project by viewing the details of the project and the project under different columns like a Kanban board. Also as soon as they accept their profile will be shown under different cards that the student's project has been assigned with a mentor. So there are different columns with cards such as sticky notes which can be shifted through one column and another. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Harshita248/Scrum-Management)

### DATING APP :
#### Ayush Kejariwal (batch 2019-23)

Ayush Kejariwal (batch 2019-23) is a wonderful Flutter developer who has created a marvelous Dating app that takes matches directly to the real world. It is made using Flutter and Firebase. The motto of the app is, “Engage with people not apps”. The app directly skips the tireless texting and directly generates meetings for dates. It’s an innovative initiative taken by Ayush and his team to develop this app. It was an immense pleasure for them to turn their perspiration into inspiration to learn new functionalities to implement with the app, along with modern UI and minimal design. Thanks to the whole Flutter community for making useful plugins that can be helpful to the community members.
